I'm a software developer trying to learn and understand more about complex topics like artificial intelligence, nutrition,
climate, psychology, and politics.

I enjoy [overlanding](https://www.onallcylinders.com/2018/07/12/overlanding-101-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-started/),
swing, salsa and country dancing, skiing, and writing. I grew up in Florida (go Gators!) but currently reside in Austin, Texas.

I think politics has gotten pretty toxic lately. I feel there's a sea change coming, but I still see a lot of outrage and division.
It seems like social media has exacerbated and deeply divided the U.S. Traditional media hasn't helped.

We cannot ever hope to arrive at moderate, sensible solutions to real problems if we can't engage with another and discuss things. Humans
are incredibly susceptible to psychological biases. It clouds our thinking. I've had several paradigm shifts in my life where I thought
the world was one way, and it turned out that it was another. I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who's never gone through a similar experience.

This blog is my attempt to dive into some of these deep topics and really try to take an objective look. My hope is that I can declare my
particular perspective on a topic, and then pivot back and forth between different sides of an issue and try to arrive at something closely
approximating truth. Wish me luck!
