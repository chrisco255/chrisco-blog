Today I'll begin posting on my personal blog journal. The idea of this journal is to capture my thoughts and learnings on several specific topics: front end development (my area of expertise), blockchain development & cryptoeconomics (using incentives to drive behavior in systems), business process management and robotic process automation (an interest of mine), startups, psychology, habits, community behaviors and more. My goal is that as I learn a new topic, as I learn something that I want to reflect on, I will write at least 3-5 paragraphs about it and post it to this blog. The topics may vary wildly. Some of them may even be quite personal. I'm not trying to appeal to any broad audience by putting these thoughts out there. I'm simply trying to teach myself. If you find any of this useful, then I'm happy to have helped you. Thanks for tuning in!
