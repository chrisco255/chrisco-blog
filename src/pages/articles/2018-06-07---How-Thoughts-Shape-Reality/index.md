Positive thinking is something that has been on my mind recently. When it comes to human relations, my experience has been that your patterns of thought literally shape your outcomes.

When I was a teenager and young adult, I had a lot of social anxiety. Being a shy extrovert, I would crave interaction with new people, but my anxiety would hold me back from truly connecting with others. I would think about what the other person was thinking of me, and I would project my own insecurities onto my interactions with other people.


Those negative thoughts would manifest themselves in the way I would perceive others' behavior. Every perceived slight was internalized greatly. Anything less than an enthusiastic response from the other person, and I would find myself assuming the absolute worst. Nevermind that they could be simply indifferent, neutral, distracted, tired, sad, angry, or any other of a huge range of moods. No, the problem was me. I was not worthy of attention or friendship.

My fears confirmed, I would from then on feel awkward about talking to the person. I would not open up. I would not share my thoughts. And this very act of closing myself off to the other person would shape my relationship with the person (in that it would suffocate and prevent it from ever taking off). 

It wasn't until later in life, when I began to learn the skills of selling that I learned just how much the way I talk, the way I listen, and the way I interact with people literally shapes my outcomes with them. If I went into a sales pitch with a negative attitude, I would fail to ask for the sale. I would fail to ask closing questions. I would fail to introduce myself. My way of thinking literally shaped my outcomes with people. Not just with sales, but literally every aspect of social interaction.

While I'm still not perfect at this today, and I still have my negative moments, I'm at least aware of this and I can use it to reflect on my outcomes. Instead of assuming the worst, that someone has it out for me or that they have negative intent, I assume the best. I assume that the other person wants to talk to me, wants to hear from me, and wants to be heard themselves. This attitude pulses through my conversations and influences it in a positive way.

To be sure, there is no guarantee of anything. Positive thinking won't always result in positive outcomes. It simply improves the odds that something will go well. But it does so significantly.
